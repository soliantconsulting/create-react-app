## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
/* block:start:cdk */
## CDK Deployment

You have to finalize the configuration within the `cdk` folder. Once done, commit and push your changes. After that,
proceed with the following steps to initialize the code pipelines:

- `cd cdk`
- `npx cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-ID/REGION` 
- `git add cdk.context.json && git commit -m "feat(ci): add cdk.context.json" && git push`
- `npx cdk deploy`

As region, choose the region your CICD stack will live in, should be `us-east-1` by default.
